    	<h2>About Me</h2>
    	<p>I was born at an early age.  No?  Too Much?  OK, let's start over.</p>
    	<p>Professionally, I'm a Solution Architect and Principle Consultant with <a href="http://www.crownpartners.com/">Crown Partners</a>, where I'm primarily focused on Adobe AEM based projects.  I live in Sacramento, California with my lovely wife <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahAnnMedina">Sarah</a> plus our dog Francisco and cat Promethacat.  My hobbies include technology of all kinds, board games, cooking, and alcoholic beverages.</p>
    	<h2>About This Blog</h2>
    	<p>I've started blogs a few times in the past, including at this domain, but for whatever reason the habit of posting on a regular basis has never stuck.  I think this is a pretty common theme, but it's one I'm trying to break.  I guess only time will tell on that front.</p>
    	<p>Under the covers, what you're reading is driven by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.  I like this setup because it's lightweight, super simple to maintain, everything is in <a href="https://github.com/shsteimer/shsteimer.github.io">version control</a>, plus there's no php involved.<p>
    	<p>In terms of topics, most of what I post will be related to technology, with a primary focus on the AEM platform I work with day-in and day-out.  I may also occasionally post about some of my other interests, but I anticipate that being the exception, not the rule.<p>
