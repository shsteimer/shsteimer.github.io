> Kiran explained that he likes it when people say I don’t know because it lends credibility to everything else that they’ve said.

I loved [this post][1] from Jason Freedman at 42 Floors, and totally related to it from the consulting world I live in.  Many consultant, especially younger consultants, are afraid to say those 3 magic words, afraid that it makes them come across as fallible, as lacking knowledge that they should have.  Certainly, you don't want to be telling your clients "I don't know" on too much of a regular basis, but being able to confidently say, "I don't know, but I'll figure it out," is often one of the telltale signs of a good consultant.
