        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born at an early age in Pittsburgh, PA, a place that no matter where life takes me will always be home. I'm a die-hard Pirates fan, and also a Penguins &amp;
        Steelers fan. I live in Sacramento, California with my wife Sarah, our dog Francisco, and cat Oreo.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I'm an AEM Technical Architect with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, where I'm primarily focused on Adobe AEM based projects.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include programming, but more generally technology of all kinds, baseball, board games, cooking, and golf.</p>
        <p>You can follow me on Twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/shsteimer">@shsteimer</a></p>
        <h2>About This Blog</h2>
        <p>I've started blogs a few times in the past, including at this domain, but for whatever reason the habit of posting on a regular basis has never stuck. I think this is a pretty common theme, but it's one I'm trying to break (Narrator: "He didn't").</p>
        <p>Under the covers, what you're reading is driven by <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I like this setup because it's static &amp; lightweight, simple to maintain, and everything is in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shsteimer/shsteimer.github.io">version control</a>. Plus there's no php involved.<p>
