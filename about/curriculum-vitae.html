        	<h2>Summary</h2>
        	<p>I’m a proven technical leader with 10+ years of experience building scale-able data and content driven applications. I have spent the last 4 years gaining deep experience in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM/CQ), having been a part of over 15 site launches in that time.<p>
        	<p>I consider myself an avid learner and am driven to stay on top of the latest and greatest frameworks, tools and libraries in order to successfully navigate a constantly changing landscape. While I am a technologist at my core, I am comfortable wearing many different hats, often within the same day, including solution architect, hands–on developer, technical leader/mentor, sales support, business analyst, and whatever else may be required.</p>

        		<p>My role with Crown evolved over the years, beginning as a java developer working on Enterprise Content Management applications based on the Documentum platform. I worked my way up to take on lead and senior development roles before switching over to focus on Day CQ/AEM in 2010. Since switching to AEM I have filled almost exclusively Technical Lead and architecture roles.</p>
